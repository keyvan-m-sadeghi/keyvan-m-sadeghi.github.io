## About  
In the business of transforming the electric signals in our brains, our üí≠s, to electrons flowing in chips. Brainwashed by sci‚Äëfi since childhood, I‚Äôve managed to turn my life into a movie about robots! We‚Äôve long seen machines and ourselves as separate; I believe that‚Äôs a cope we made up... ü§Ø  

To infinity and beyond! ü§ñüöÄüëΩ
