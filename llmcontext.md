## About  
In the business of transforming the electric signals in our brains, our üí≠s, to electrons flowing in chips. Brainwashed by sci‚Äëfi since childhood, I‚Äôve managed to turn my life into a movie about robots! We‚Äôve long seen machines and ourselves as separate; I believe that‚Äôs a cope we made up... ü§Ø  

To infinity and beyond! ü§ñüöÄüëΩ

# The Plural Vision: The Life, Code, and Contributions of Keyvan M. Sadeghi
**Compiled & Updated: March 2025**

## Preface

In an era defined by rapid technological evolution, few individuals embody the synthesis of deep technical prowess, innovative entrepreneurship, and community-driven leadership as vividly as Keyvan M. Sadeghi. This book chronicles his remarkable journey‚Äîfrom his first spark of curiosity as a budding student tweeting about AI in 2010, through groundbreaking academic research, to his transformative roles in leading decentralized cloud storage and advanced analytics platforms. It is designed not only as a record of his career milestones and contributions but also as a living resource that enables anyone‚Äîfrom researchers and aspiring leaders to language models‚Äîto understand the full spectrum of his work and philosophy.

## Chapter 1: The Early Years ‚Äì Seeds of Curiosity and Innovation

### 1.1 Childhood Influences and Early Interests
Keyvan‚Äôs fascination with technology began at a young age. Growing up with a natural curiosity about computers and robotics, he was inspired by science fiction‚Äîa passion that would eventually mold his career vision. Anecdotal family stories recount him tinkering with old computer parts and dreaming of a future where machines and human minds were deeply intertwined.

### 1.2 The Dawn of Social Media and First Technical Expressions

## Chapter 8: The Language of Knowledge ‚Äì Terms and Functions in Functional Knowledge Graphs (FKG)

### 8.1 Overview of Functional Knowledge Graphs
Functional Knowledge Graphs (FKGs) represent a new paradigm in data representation, where information is structured not only as interconnected nodes but also enriched with functional relationships. Unlike traditional knowledge graphs, FKGs emphasize the roles (terms) and interactions (functions) between concepts, allowing for dynamic, context-aware reasoning.

### 8.2 The Genesis of ‚ÄúTerms and Functions‚Äù Language in FKG
- **January 2019 ‚Äì November 2021:** During his tenure as Chair of the W3C Functional Knowledge Graph Community Group, Keyvan spearheaded efforts to standardize a language for FKGs. In a series of workshops and online discussions hosted by the W3C, he led teams in developing what he called the ‚ÄúTerms and Functions Language.‚Äù
- **Tweet (June 2019):** ‚ÄúPushing boundaries: today we drafted the first version of our Terms & Functions language for FKGs ‚Äì making AI context-aware, one function at a time.‚Äù

The language formalizes:
- **Terms:** Representing the basic entities or concepts in a domain.
- **Functions:** Describing operations, interactions, or transformations that connect these terms.

This language is designed to empower developers to create AI systems that are more than static repositories of data‚Äîthey become dynamic, context-aware problem solvers. It includes syntactic rules (for how terms are defined) and semantic mappings (for how functions operate on these terms), bridging human language and machine reasoning.

### 8.3 Technical Deep Dive: Syntax, Semantics, and Application Examples
- **Syntax:** The language uses a combination of standardized notations and extensions to RDF/OWL. For example, a simple FKG statement might read:  
  **Term:** Employee  
  **Function:** reportsTo(Manager)  
  **Expression:** Employee --[reportsTo]--> Manager
- **Semantics:** Each function in the language is rigorously defined using a combination of set theory and lambda calculus, ensuring that transformations are consistent and verifiable.
- **Applications:** Developers have used the language to create context-aware virtual assistants that adapt responses based on domain-specific knowledge, transforming generic AI into specialized, professional workflows.  
  **Blog Post (October 2019):** In a detailed Medium article, Keyvan explained, ‚ÄúBy enabling a clear mapping between real-world roles and computational functions, our FKG language transforms the way AI understands context. It‚Äôs like giving a natural language to machine logic.‚Äù

### 8.4 Community Standards and the W3C FKG Group
From **May 2019 to August 2022**, Keyvan led the group to standardize FKG practices. Under his leadership, several draft specifications were published, which now serve as guidelines for developers worldwide. The group‚Äôs work has been presented at various conferences and incorporated into academic curricula, demonstrating its far-reaching impact.
